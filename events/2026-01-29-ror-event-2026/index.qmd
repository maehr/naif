## About

The Research on Research Event 2026 brings together the Swiss Research on Research community for two days of talks, discussion, and collaborative work.

Following the event, the organisers shared the presentation slides on Zenodo ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.18478818](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18478818)). The CRS also launched the **CRS Seed Grants**, a funding opportunity for Swiss researchers to initiate collaborative Research on Research projects ([call for proposals](https://www.crs.uzh.ch/en/news/2026-News/CRS-Seed-Grants.html)).
