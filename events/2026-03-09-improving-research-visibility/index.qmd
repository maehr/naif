## About

This one-day course focuses on how academic libraries can improve the visibility of institutional research output. Participants work on dissemination strategies, metadata curation practices, and approaches for supporting researchers in making their work easier to find.

The course is led by Simon Willemin and Julien Sicot, and is aimed at library staff from higher education and research institutions.
