    "text": "International inputs — What can we learn?\nThe event offered exciting insights from three countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, and Finland. The presentation slides are available on Zenodo (DOIs):\n\nOpen Science in the open - perspectives on the governance and infrastructure landscape in Denmark\nImplementing Secondary Publishing Rights in the Netherlands\nOpen Research Information in Finland: Research.fi\n\n\nDenmark: Using a communication campaign to bring about cultural change\nKira Stine Hansen (Copenhagen University Library, Royal Danish Library) and Michael Svendsen (Copenhagen University Library) provided insights into the complex and, in some cases, functionally parallel research infrastructure landscape in Denmark. Copenhagen University Library thereby plays a leading role in governance and infrastructure for Open Science. The cultural shift towards Open Science has largely been made possible thanks to a forward-looking communication and marketing strategy that involves researchers in the ongoing decision-making processes. The core message of their input: Collaboration is necessary because only together can we make a difference and be resilient. And while institutions collaborate, it is important to keep the focus on the “why” and not deviate into the discussions of the “how”. A unified, consistent approach is just as important as the alignment of Open Science policies and cultural values.\n\n\nThe Netherlands: Secondary publication right without administration for researchers\nArjan Schalken (Network of Dutch University Libraries and the Royal Library) and Wenneke Meerstadt (Utrecht University Library) also emphasized the importance of a uniform approach to implementing a national secondary publication right at the local level in the Netherlands. Under the motto “You share – we take care,” the library team entered researchers’ publications into the local repository in two initial phases. The implementation project is currently in its successful third phase (opt-out phase, in which researchers must notify the library if they do NOT wish to make use of the secondary publication right). Six success factors have contributed to the successful implementation in the Netherlands:\n\nAn executable (concrete) guideline was drawn up with the help of one (!) legal expert and presented to all institutions for implementation.\nThe university administrations were committed because they had to report to the ministry.\nThe right of secondary publication empowered senior management and libraries to archive and publish the institution’s own publications.\nAll institutions agreed that they would stand together in the event of legal action by publishers (no legal action has been taken to date).\nPilot projects (phase 1) helped generate support from researchers, identify adjustments for internal workflows, and gauge the reactions of publishers.\nThe administrative burden on researchers was extremely low. The repository managers took on most of the work.\n\n\n\n\nWenneke Meerstadt speaking\n\n\n\n\nFinland: Making research visible, interoperable, and reusable with research.fi\nJukka Hapaamäki (Ministry of Education & Culture) and Hanna-Mari Puuska (CSC – IT Center for Science) concluded by reporting on the Finnish research information hub research.fi, which provides an overview of all research output from Finnish universities. This platform was created by CSC on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Culture as a control mechanism for university funding. The publication figures, which are automatically compiled from local data sources, are particularly impressive, while other information – such as information on research data – still appears relatively sparse (which is partly due to the limited availability of information on research data).\nThe national catalog provides information on publications, research data, infrastructures, researchers, projects, research organizations, and groups, and it obtains its data from the institutions themselves as well as from research funding agencies, data services, ORCID, and national registers."

    "text": "Key take-aways\nAfter the three keynote speeches, the event concluded with a short discussion round. The most important stakeholders in the Swiss landscape had their say: it was once again made clear that collaborative and coordinated efforts are necessary, because only together can we achieve the goals we have set ourselves. Institutions should also not be afraid to learn from each other – as the example of the Netherlands has shown, this contributes significantly to success. And while some stakeholders already operate similar research information platforms (SNSF, SWITCH), they nevertheless expressed interest in a national project. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how such a national platform should be structured: should it be more of a monitoring tool for Open Science or a steering instrument for strategic decision-makers in the higher education and research system (e.g., university management, but also research funding bodies such as SNSF and/or SERI)? Should it be a platform or catalog that provides metadata or a repository where materials can also be stored (similar to institutional repositories)? Further discussions will be held in the coming months to find a solution for Switzerland – together.\nFurther NAIF deliverables: Zenodo community\nAbout the project: The NAIF project (2025–2026) is supported by eight Swiss universities and co-financed by swissuniversities. The project aims to enable greater interoperability and standardization between institutional repositories in Switzerland. The project is led by ETH Zurich / ETH Library. Other participants include: UZH / Zurich University Library, EPFL, ZHAW, PH St. Gallen, University of Fribourg, University of Neuchâtel, and the University of St. Gallen.\nDr Melanie Röthlisberger, Open Science Services"

The event was open to anyone interested in the future of Swiss research infrastructure and served as a public introduction to NAIF - the National Approach for Interoperable repositories and Findable research results.\nThe session presented the project’s four key objectives. First, it outlined the goal of promoting the responsible use of quantitative indicators in research assessment, supporting the prioritisation of metadata standardisation within repositories. Second, the project will compare national approaches across Europe and develop feasible scenarios for Switzerland by engaging key stakeholders. Third, a comprehensive survey and analysis of Swiss institutional repositories will lay the groundwork for greater standardisation and interoperability. Fourth, the project aims to enhance national and global academic data through measures such as the consistent use of persistent identifiers for organisations, researchers, and funding."

The programme featured lightning talks and workshops with speakers from ETH Zurich, EPFL, the University of Zurich, TU Wien, SNF, Lib4RI, Crossref, and other institutions, presenting tools, applied methods, and innovative use cases around platforms such as OpenAlex, OpenAIRE, ORCID, and Crossref.\nNAIF contributed a lightning talk titled “Enhancing Open Academic Data through the NAIF Project,” presented by Pascale Bouton, Jorge Rodrigues de Matos, and Julien Sicot (EPFL) together with Simon Willemin (ETH Zurich). The talk introduced Track 4 of the NAIF project, focusing on the enhancement of national and global academic data across four dimensions: organizational data, authorship data, funding data, and open access information. The presentation highlighted open questions and tasks that require collective effort across Swiss institutions.\nThe presentation slides are available on Zenodo: Bouton, P., Rodrigues de Matos, J., Sicot, J., & Willemin, S.

    "text": "About\nDer Workshop wird in Kooperation mit der ETH-Bibliothek organisiert.\nIn der Schweiz haben zahlreiche Hochschulen die San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) unterzeichnet und/oder sind Mitglied der Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) geworden. DORA und CoARA zielen auf eine Reform der Bewertung wissenschaftlicher Leistungen ab, die u.a. durch folgende Prinzipien gekennzeichnet ist: der Verzicht auf bestimmte als problematisch erachtete Metriken, die Priorisierung von Qualität vor Quantität sowie eine umfassendere Beurteilung von Forschenden anhand vielfältiger Kriterien - nicht nur aufgrund von Publikationsleistungen und Drittmittelakquise.\nDas Commitment, das Hochschulen mit der DORA-Unterzeichnung bzw. CoARA-Mitgliedschaft eingegangen sind, spiegelt sich zunehmend in angepassten Prozessen bei Berufungsverfahren und anderen Stellenbesetzungen wider. Der Workshop dient dem Erfahrungsaustausch und hat zum Ziel, Herausforderungen bei der Implementierung zu diskutieren, Tools und Best Practices zu identifizieren und Weiterentwicklungsansätze für die eigene Institution zu erarbeiten.\nUm von nationalen und internationalen Erfahrungen zu profitieren, werden drei Impulsvorträge angeboten:\nKarin Gilland Lutz und Mihaela Falub stellen das Projekt HI-FRAME vor, das darauf abzielte, die Berufungen von UZH-Professor:innen mit der Open-Science-Bewegung in Einklang zu bringen.\nKatrin Brugger und Andreas Raggautz stellen das Activity Framework der Universität Graz vor, welches die Leistungen von Forschenden differenzierter darzustellen versucht.\nPeter Kraker und Christoph Arthofer präsentieren VisConnect, ein Projekt, in dem Open Knowledge Maps gemeinsam mit der IT:U Interdisciplinary Transformation University Austria ein Tool entwickelt hat, das die Umgestaltung von Forschungsbewertungsprozessen unterstützt."

    "text": "Project abstract\nCompared to other countries, Switzerland lacks a systematic overview of the output (e.g. scientific publications) produced by researchers at Swiss Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Most institutions have their own repositories in which a large number of their publications are listed. However, these repositories differ in coverage of the institutional research outputs and completeness of metadata for the available publications.\nThe project aims (1) to make research outputs by researchers at Swiss HEIs more visible, and (2) to optimise the data basis for monitoring and steering Swiss research in general and OA publications in particular. To achieve these overarching goals, the project will work towards more standardisation and interoperability across repositories in Swiss HEIs and develop scenarios for a national approach to disseminate and reuse Swiss research results. In addition, the project aims (3) to promote the responsible use of indicators for research assessment on the basis of the national approach and standardised repositories."

The talk, titled “Enhancing Open Academic Data through the NAIF Project,” introduced Track 4 of the NAIF project, which is dedicated to the enhancement of national and global academic data.\nThe presentation addressed four critical dimensions of academic metadata: organisational data, authorship data, funding data, and open access information. For each dimension, the speakers highlighted the key challenges that Swiss institutions face today - from standardising organisational structures and units, to ensuring reliable researcher identifiers, linking publications to funding sources, and capturing accurate open access metadata."

    "text": "What we found\nRather than presenting ready-made solutions, the talk foregrounded open questions and tasks that require collective effort across institutions. The core insight: good practices already exist at local level in many Swiss institutions, but scaling them nationally and exploring opportunities for harmonisation remains a shared challenge. The SOAD Day audience - researchers, data scientists, and practitioners from across Switzerland - engaged actively with these questions, confirming that metadata quality is a widely felt concern."
