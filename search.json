    "text": "International inputs — What can we learn?\nThe event offered exciting insights from three countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, and Finland. The presentation slides can now be downloaded from the Zenodo community of the NAIF project.\n\nDenmark: Using a communication campaign to bring about cultural change\nKira Stine Hansen (Copenhagen University Library, Royal Danish Library) and Michael Svendsen (Copenhagen University Library) provided insights into the complex and, in some cases, functionally parallel research infrastructure landscape in Denmark. Copenhagen University Library thereby plays a leading role in governance and infrastructure for Open Science. The cultural shift towards Open Science has largely been made possible thanks to a forward-looking communication and marketing strategy that involves researchers in the ongoing decision-making processes. The core message of their input: Collaboration is necessary because only together can we make a difference and be resilient. And while institutions collaborate, it is important to keep the focus on the “why” and not deviate into the discussions of the “how”. A unified, consistent approach is just as important as the alignment of Open Science policies and cultural values.\n\n\n\nMichael Svendsen and Kira Stine Hansen\n\n\n\n\nThe Netherlands: Secondary publication right without administration for researchers\nArjan Schalken (Network of Dutch University Libraries and the Royal Library) and Wenneke Meerstadt (Utrecht University Library) also emphasized the importance of a uniform approach to implementing a national secondary publication right at the local level in the Netherlands. Under the motto “You share – we take care,” the library team entered researchers’ publications into the local repository in two initial phases. The implementation project is currently in its successful third phase (opt-out phase, in which researchers must notify the library if they do NOT wish to make use of the secondary publication right). Six success factors have contributed to the successful implementation in the Netherlands:\n\nAn executable (concrete) guideline was drawn up with the help of one (!) legal expert and presented to all institutions for implementation.\nThe university administrations were committed because they had to report to the ministry.\nThe right of secondary publication empowered senior management and libraries to archive and publish the institution’s own publications.\nAll institutions agreed that they would stand together in the event of legal action by publishers (no legal action has been taken to date).\nPilot projects (phase 1) helped generate support from researchers, identify adjustments for internal workflows, and gauge the reactions of publishers.\nThe administrative burden on researchers was extremely low. The repository managers took on most of the work.\n\n\n\n\nWenneke Meerstadt speaking\n\n\n\n\nFinland: Making research visible, interoperable, and reusable with research.fi\nJukka Hapaamäki (Ministry of Education & Culture) and Hanna-Mari Puuska (CSC – IT Center for Science) concluded by reporting on the Finnish research information hub research.fi, which provides an overview of all research output from Finnish universities. This platform was created by CSC on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Culture as a control mechanism for university funding. The publication figures, which are automatically compiled from local data sources, are particularly impressive, while other information – such as information on research data – still appears relatively sparse (which is partly due to the limited availability of information on research data).\nThe national catalog provides information on publications, research data, infrastructures, researchers, projects, research organizations, and groups, and it obtains its data from the institutions themselves as well as from research funding agencies, data services, ORCID, and national registers."

The most important stakeholders in the Swiss landscape had their say: it was once again made clear that collaborative and coordinated efforts are necessary, because only together can we achieve the goals we have set ourselves. Institutions should also not be afraid to learn from each other – as the example of the Netherlands has shown, this contributes significantly to success. And while some stakeholders already operate similar research information platforms (SNSF, SWITCH), they nevertheless expressed interest in a national project. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how such a national platform should be structured: should it be more of a monitoring tool for Open Science or a steering instrument for strategic decision-makers in the higher education and research system (e.g., university management, but also research funding bodies such as SNSF and/or SERI)? Should it be a platform or catalog that provides metadata or a repository where materials can also be stored (similar to institutional repositories)? Further discussions will be held in the coming months to find a solution for Switzerland – together.\nDownload presentations: from the NAIF-Zenodo community\nAbout the project: The NAIF project (2025–2026) is supported by eight Swiss universities and co-financed by swissuniversities.

    "text": "Background and objectives\nCompared to other countries, Switzerland lacks a systematic overview of the output (e.g., scientific publications) produced by researchers at Swiss Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Most institutions have their own repositories in which a large number of their publications are listed. However, these repositories differ in coverage of the institutional research outputs and completeness of metadata for the available publications. An Open Access (OA) monitor has been implemented in Switzerland, which provides a rough overview of the distribution of OA publications, amongst other things. While the implementation of this monitor was a step in the right direction, it does not allow standardized data analysis beyond answering simple questions. In sum, little information and data are available on research conducted at Swiss HEIs, with the consequence that Swiss research is less visible and Swiss policymakers still rely on traditional university rankings and external data providers for monitoring and steering, rather than consulting standardized, high-quality information provided by local HEIs. The project aims (1) to make research outputs by researchers at Swiss HEIs more visible, and (2) to optimize the data basis for monitoring and steering Swiss research in general and OA publications in particular. To achieve these overarching goals, the project will work towards more standardization and interoperability across repositories in Swiss HEIs and develop scenarios for a national approach to disseminate and reuse Swiss research results. In addition, the project aims (3) to promote the responsible use of indicators for research assessment on the basis of the national approach and standardized repositories.\nThe project aims to create a basis for a national approach that considers both conceptual requirements and technical requirements. The project is divided in four tracks accompanied by a unified outcome providing a foundation for a national approach that is aligned with current trends in research assessment and open science practices, and a thorough understanding of the key factors that ensure the dissemination (i.e., integration of national output in global ecosystems) and findability (i.e., high-quality metadata) of the research outputs deposited in Swiss institutional repositories."

    "text": "Tracks\n\nTrack 1: Responsible use of quantitative indicators\nResponsible partners: ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, ETH Zurich, University of Zurich (CHESS)\nThis track aims at promoting the responsible use of indicators for research assessment on the basis of the national approach (track 2) and standardized repositories (tracks 3-4). In particular, with the responsible use of quantitative indicators we seek a way that is compliant with the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), and that takes into account current international trends in open science. Our work should help to prioritize standardization of metadata in repositories. We will involve participants of Swiss Year of Scientometrics (SYoS). SYoS brought together a community of experts from different organisations and at different levels to discuss research assessments, bibliometric methods and open science practices. An active participation of the Center for Higher Education and Science Studies (CHESS) is planned as well. We will also try to reach out to the CoARA Working group on Responsible Metrics and Indicators (RMI) to further strengthen connections with CoARA.\n\n\nTrack 2: Review of national approaches and development of scenarios for Switzerland\nResponsible partners: University of Zurich, ETH Zurich\nThis track will start with a structured, collaborative workshop format, inviting experts from countries with similar but also different frameworks to share insights and experiences. The workshop will facilitate a comparative analysis of national strategies. The focus will be on key governmental and institutional stakeholders, funding mechanisms, sustainability models, cost-effectiveness and technical solutions (e.g. federated vs. centralised systems). The findings will be reviewed to identify gaps and challenges specific to Switzerland. Then, engaging key national stakeholders will be essential to identify requirements, expectations, and challenges through consultations including roundtables and white papers. Based on these insights, a well-founded proposal will be drafted and refined in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders to ensure its feasibility and long-term success. Moreover, the introduction of a secondary publication right will be taken into account.\n\n\nTrack 3: Survey and analysis of Swiss institutional repositories\nResponsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL\nThis track focuses on the existing institutional repositories. The starting point will be a list of institutional repositories from institutions that are accredited by swissuniversities. Such an inventory aims to provide an in-depth analysis of repositories, and can be seen as a systematic extension of the broad overview given through the list of participating institutions in the Swiss Open Access Monitor. Part of these repositories will be investigated in terms of (a) already implemented standards and certifications (e.g., OpenAIRE guidelines, CoreTrustSeal) as well as repository software currently in use, (b) metadata availability, quality, and completeness, evaluating their alignment with international best practices (e.g., OpenAIRE, Dublin Core, DataCite), (c) technical requirements identifying existing barriers to seamless data exchange and integration. Because of the heterogeneity of the current landscape and the number of institutions (50+), some parts of the inventory may focus on a subset of institutions whose selection will partly depend on institutions’ willingness to participate. Once the inventory has been completed, a report featuring the results of the gap analysis will be prepared. The report will help to determine common denominators among institutional repositories to assess the feasibility of metadata harmonization. It may also provide feasible recommendations to enhance alignment with national and international frameworks (e.g., OpenAIRE guidelines), help building a shared and standardized metadata framework that takes the characteristics of Switzerland into account.\n\n\nTrack 4: Enhancement of national and global academic data\nResponsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL\nThis track focuses on data that have already been, or that will be, integrated into institutional repositories, but that are sourced elsewhere, such as identifiers for Swiss organizations (e.g., ROR), researchers active in Switzerland (e.g., ORCID), funding information for Swiss or international projects and OA information (OA type, document version, embargo, APCs). A workshop and a virtual session will gather stakeholders to determine which academic data are relevant, and which measures or actions could be taken to improve their findability or their quality. The workshop and the virtual session will also determine the selection of measures or actions that will be implemented. These translate into deliverables that could consist in guidelines or in concrete actions such as the establishment of a mapping of Swiss organizations or an authoritative list of researchers active in the country.\n\n\nUnified outcome: Creation of a working group\nResponsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL, ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, University of Zurich\nThis unified outcome aims to establish a working group that will make advancements towards more interoperability and standardization across institutional repositories in Switzerland. Using the preliminary findings of the conceptual requirements identified by the tracks responsible use of quantitative indicators and review of national approaches and development of scenarios for Switzerland as well as the technical recommendations of the tracks survey and analysis of Swiss institutional repositories and enhancement of national and global academic data, project participants will define the status of the working group, its organizational form, criteria of representativity, as well as goals, strategy, and actions to enhance the visibility of Swiss research results and to ensure smooth data dissemination."

    "text": "NAIF consortium logos\n\n\nWe are launching a national survey to map and better understand the landscape of institutional repositories in Switzerland. The initiative aims to strengthen interoperability, standardisation, and coordination across the country’s research information ecosystem.\nThe survey explores how repositories are managed, described, and sustained, focusing on infrastructure, metadata practices, governance, and long-term strategies. It seeks to identify common strengths, gaps, and challenges, laying the groundwork for a national roadmap aligned with international standards and open science principles.\nThe questionnaire is addressed to repository managers and service leads from Swiss higher education institutions operating repositories or CRIS systems. Each manager will be contacted directly to participate.\nTo support respondents, two Q&A sessions will be organised:\n\nThursday, 20 November 2025, 11:00-12:00 (French)\nWednesday, 26 November 2025, 15:00-16:00 (German)\n\nThe survey draws inspiration from major international efforts, including:\n\nhttps://zenodo.org/records/10390626\nhttps://zenodo.org/records/10255559\nhttps://coar-repositories.org/news-updates/open-consultation-crafting-a-vision-for-european-repositories/\nhttps://zenodo.org/records/15730917\nhttps://barcelona-declaration.org/\n\nThis will be the first national overview of repository maturity and practices in Switzerland. Findings will inform coordinated actions and shared services, and aggregated results will be published openly on Zenodo within the NAIF community.\nDeadline: 15 December 2025\nContact: mailto:naif-survey@library.ethz.ch\nTake the survey: https://www.surveyhero.com/c/naif-repositories-2025"
