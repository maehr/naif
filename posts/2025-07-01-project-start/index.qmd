## Approved project listing

According to the official list of approved projects, **NAIF (National Approach for Interoperable repositories and Findable research results)** is led by **ETH Library / ETH Zurich**, with partner institutions **UZH, EPFL, ZHAW, PHSG, UNIFR, UNINE, and HSG**.

The listing reports total project costs of **CHF 588,000** and requested funds of **CHF 293,000**.

## Project abstract

Compared to other countries, Switzerland lacks a systematic overview of the output (e.g. scientific publications) produced by researchers at Swiss Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Most institutions have their own repositories in which a large number of their publications are listed. However, these repositories differ in coverage of the institutional research outputs and completeness of metadata for the available publications.

The project aims (1) to make research outputs by researchers at Swiss HEIs more visible, and (2) to optimise the data basis for monitoring and steering Swiss research in general and OA publications in particular. To achieve these overarching goals, the project will work towards more standardisation and interoperability across repositories in Swiss HEIs and develop scenarios for a national approach to disseminate and reuse Swiss research results. In addition, the project aims (3) to promote the responsible use of indicators for research assessment on the basis of the national approach and standardised repositories.
