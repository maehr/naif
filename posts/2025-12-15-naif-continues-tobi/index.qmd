description: "TOBI (Towards Open Bibliometric Indicators) produced a practical evidence base on open scholarly metadata in Switzerland: where data quality and coverage already support analysis, where systematic gaps remain, and which interventions improve visibility of institutional research outputs. NAIF builds on these results with a broader interoperability scope and stronger cross-institution coordination."

## What TOBI established

TOBI (Towards Open Bibliometric Indicators) closed in July 2025 with more than a conceptual discussion: it delivered analyses, methods, tools, and curation work that can be reused by Swiss institutions. The project poster, *A 2-year retrospective into the open information landscape: Learnings from the TOBI project* (Kubacka, Willemin, and Dederke, 2025), brings these results together in a single overview.

The evidence also clarifies an important point: despite the project name, TOBI focused primarily on the quality, coverage, and usability of open scholarly **data** rather than on promoting indicators as an end in themselves. NAIF continues from that same premise, but in a wider interoperability context where data quality conditions become operational requirements across repositories.

## Which TOBI results NAIF carries forward

### 1) Data quality as infrastructure

TOBI's comparative analyses showed that coverage and metadata quality differ substantially between open and commercial databases, and also across institution types and sizes in Switzerland. For NAIF, this means data quality is not a technical afterthought but core infrastructure for credible analysis and fair representation.

NAIF therefore continues TOBI's focus in Track 3 and Track 4 by assessing metadata availability and quality in Swiss repositories and prioritising concrete improvement actions. Key recurring issues remain: inconsistent organisation names, incomplete affiliation links, and uneven metadata completeness across systems.

### 2) Identifier-oriented improvement (ROR and ORCID)

TOBI repeatedly showed that findability depends on disambiguation and consistent identifiers. NAIF continues this through explicit work on organisational and researcher identifiers, including ROR (Research Organization Registry) and ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) alignment in repository workflows.

The key shift is from diagnosing identifier problems in external databases to supporting local and national processes that prevent these problems at source.

### 3) Responsible use of indicators based on data conditions

TOBI used transparency principles aligned with DORA (the Declaration on Research Assessment), with a clear emphasis on data provenance and methodological openness. NAIF continues that orientation through its responsible-indicator work (Track 1), while keeping a stronger analytical distinction between data readiness and indicator interpretation.

This helps move from general endorsement of responsible assessment to a clearer operational question: what data conditions must be met before indicators are interpreted or compared?

### 4) Reuse of outputs and community building

TOBI delivered reusable assets, including publications, datasets, code resources, practical recommendations, and curated affiliation data. NAIF continues this reuse-first approach through workshops, cross-institution dialogue, and openly shared deliverables.

Importantly, NAIF adds a governance perspective: findings from the four tracks are designed to feed into a national working-group model that can sustain coordination after the project period.

## What changes with NAIF

TOBI primarily answered: *How reliable are open bibliometric sources and metadata for Swiss higher education institutions (HEIs), and what should improve first?*

NAIF adds: *How do Swiss repositories and stakeholders coordinate these improvements so that national findability and interoperability become durable rather than project-bound?*

The key shift is therefore from evidence generation to implementation design: defining who updates what data, in which systems, with which standards, and with what feedback loops.
