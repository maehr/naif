description: "In January 2026, the Swiss Library Service Platform (SLSP) published its strategy for the period 2026-2029. The document outlines how SLSP plans to evolve from a library management infrastructure into a platform for academic information that is user-oriented, data- and AI-driven, interoperable, and open."

## Why it matters

SLSP and NAIF address different layers of the Swiss academic information ecosystem. SLSP provides the operational platform through which academic libraries manage, discover, and deliver information. NAIF works at the standards and data-quality layer, aiming to make institutional repositories more interoperable and their metadata more consistent. Neither initiative can fully succeed in isolation. High-quality, standardised metadata — the kind NAIF is working towards — is a precondition for the reliable discovery and AI-driven services that SLSP envisions. Conversely, a national platform like SLSP is a key channel through which improved repository data reaches researchers and students.

## What we found

Reading the SLSP strategy through the lens of NAIF's objectives, three areas of strong alignment stand out.

First, both initiatives are grounded in **open science**. SLSP's vision explicitly commits to operating "in the spirit of open science" and references the [Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information](https://barcelona-declaration.org/). NAIF's work on interoperability, findability, and open access monitoring serves the same principles. Open, transparent infrastructure is a shared foundation.

Second, **metadata quality and data competence** are priorities on both sides. SLSP's strategic area on digital autonomy emphasizes cataloguing, archiving, and publication competencies tied to a central data strategy. NAIF's [Track 3](https://maehr.github.io/naif/about.html#track-3-survey-and-analysis-of-swiss-institutional-repositories) inventories metadata practices across Swiss repositories, while [Track 4](https://maehr.github.io/naif/about.html#track-4-enhancement-of-national-and-global-academic-data) focuses on enhancing scholarly data such as persistent identifiers ([ROR](https://ror.org/), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/)), funding information, and open access metadata. These efforts are naturally complementary: NAIF produces gap analyses and recommendations, and platforms like SLSP could benefit from implementing them.

Third, both initiatives invest in **collaborative governance**. SLSP is deepening its partnerships with SWITCH and its engagement in the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries. NAIF is building a working group to sustain interoperability and standardisation efforts beyond the project's end in December 2026. The Swiss academic information landscape is small enough that these governance structures should be aware of each other and, where useful, coordinated.

A further connection — though less direct — concerns **AI and discovery**. SLSP places significant emphasis on AI-supported services for metadata management, search, and user support. NAIF does not address AI, but the SLSP strategy itself makes the case for why our work matters in this context: "Without robust, open knowledge bases, AI output remains vulnerable to bias, misinterpretation and oversimplification." Standardised, interoperable repository metadata is part of that robust base.

## What's next

NAIF and SLSP solve different problems. NAIF is a time-limited project focused on standards, inventories, and recommendations for institutional repositories. SLSP is an operational platform serving academic libraries across Switzerland. We do not see ourselves as overlapping, but as **complementary**.

That said, the areas of alignment are real and worth acting on. Colleagues from SLSP participated in several NAIF events, which is a welcome signal. Going forward, we see opportunities for exchange and coordination especially around metadata standardisation, open access monitoring, and the governance structures both initiatives are developing.

We welcome continued dialogue — whether through our [events](https://maehr.github.io/naif/events/index.html), through the [working group](https://maehr.github.io/naif/about.html#unified-outcome-creation-of-a-working-group) we are establishing, or informally. If you are involved with SLSP or its member libraries and want to stay in touch with NAIF's progress, you can [fill out our contact form](https://forms.gle/hAQwHaitKDZ3Cf846) or reach us at [naif@library.ethz.ch](mailto:naif@library.ethz.ch).
