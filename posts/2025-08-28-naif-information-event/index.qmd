## Why it matters

Switzerland currently lacks a systematic overview of the research output produced at its Higher Education Institutions. Most institutions maintain their own repositories, but these differ considerably in terms of coverage, completeness, and technical standards. This fragmentation severely limits the possibilities for evaluation, analysis, and strategic steering of Swiss research at the national level.

## What we did

On Thursday, 28 August 2025, the ETH Library and its seven partner institutions hosted the first official NAIF information event online. The event was open to anyone interested in the future of Swiss research infrastructure and served as a public introduction to NAIF - the National Approach for Interoperable repositories and Findable research results.

The session presented the project's four key objectives. First, it outlined the goal of promoting the responsible use of quantitative indicators in research assessment, supporting the prioritisation of metadata standardisation within repositories. Second, the project will compare national approaches across Europe and develop feasible scenarios for Switzerland by engaging key stakeholders. Third, a comprehensive survey and analysis of Swiss institutional repositories will lay the groundwork for greater standardisation and interoperability. Fourth, the project aims to enhance national and global academic data through measures such as the consistent use of persistent identifiers for organisations, researchers, and funding.

## What we found

The event highlighted broad interest in the topic, with participants joining from across the Swiss higher education landscape. The discussion reinforced that making Swiss research output more visible is not just a technical challenge but also a question of governance, collaboration, and cultural change.

## What's next

The NAIF project, which runs from July 2025 to December 2026, will continue with a series of workshops and consultations across all four tracks. Upcoming activities include workshops on the responsible use of quantitative scientometric indicators, academic metadata improvement, and a national survey of Swiss institutional repositories. All interested parties are welcome to follow the project's progress and get involved.
