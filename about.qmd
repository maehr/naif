## At a glance

- **Duration:** July 2025 to December 2026
- **Funding:** Eight Swiss Higher Education Institutions and swissuniversities
- **Focus:** Interoperability and standardisation across Swiss institutional repositories
- **Contact:** [naif@library.ethz.ch](mailto:naif@library.ethz.ch)

## Project in brief

Swiss Higher Education Institutions operate institutional repositories with varying practices and metadata quality. This fragmentation makes national-level discovery, monitoring, and analysis difficult.

NAIF addresses this by combining conceptual design (national scenarios and governance choices) with technical implementation work (metadata harmonisation and interoperability requirements).

### Partners

The project partners are:

- [ETH Library (ETH Zurich)](https://library.ethz.ch/en/)
- [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html)
- [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)
- [ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/)
- [PHSG St.Gallen University of Teacher Education](https://www.phsg.ch/en/)

## Objectives

- Make research outputs by researchers at Swiss HEIs more visible.
- Improve the data basis for monitoring and steering Swiss research, with a focus on Open Access.
- Promote the responsible use of indicators in research assessment, aligned with DORA and CoARA.

## Approach

- Work towards shared standards and interoperability across repositories.
- Develop scenarios for a national approach to disseminate and reuse Swiss research results.
- Identify the factors that ensure dissemination (integration into global ecosystems) and findability (high-quality metadata).

## Timeline

| Period | Milestone |
|---|---|
| July 2025 | Project start |
| 2025-2026 | Track activities: workshops, inventories, consultations, recommendations |
| December 2026 | Project end |

## Tracks

NAIF is organised into four coordinated tracks plus one cross-track outcome.

### Track 1: Responsible use of quantitative indicators

*Responsible partners: ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, ETH Zurich, University of Zurich (CHESS)*

This track promotes responsible use of indicators for research assessment and links indicator practice with repository interoperability.

- Align guidance with DORA and CoARA.
- Connect indicator use to metadata standardisation priorities.
- Engage the Swiss Year of Scientometrics (SYoS) community and CHESS.

### Track 2: National scenarios for Switzerland

*Responsible partners: University of Zurich, ETH Zurich*

This track reviews international national approaches and develops options for Switzerland.

- Run structured workshops with international experts.
- Compare governance models, funding, sustainability, and technical setups (federated vs centralised).
- Gather Swiss stakeholder requirements through consultations (for example roundtables and white papers).
- Consider secondary publication rights.

### Track 3: Survey of Swiss repositories

*Responsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL*

This track analyses Swiss institutional repositories, starting from the list of [accredited institutions by swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/studying/accredited-swiss-higher-education-institutions-1), and extends context from the [Swiss Open Access Monitor](https://oamonitor.ch/wiki/participating-institutions-repo-monitor/).

- Assess standards, certifications, and repository software (for example OpenAIRE guidelines and CoreTrustSeal).
- Evaluate metadata availability, quality, and completeness against international practices (OpenAIRE, Dublin Core, DataCite).
- Identify technical barriers to seamless data exchange and integration.
- Produce a gap-analysis report with recommendations for harmonisation and alignment.

### Track 4: Enhancement of national and global academic data

*Responsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL*

This track focuses on enrichment data used in repositories, including identifiers and contextual metadata.

- Address organisation identifiers (for example ROR), researcher identifiers (for example ORCID), funding data, and Open Access metadata.
- Use workshops and virtual sessions to prioritise relevant data improvements.
- Convert priorities into practical deliverables, such as mappings, authoritative lists, and implementation guidance.

### Unified outcome: National working group

*Responsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL, ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, University of Zurich*

Findings across all tracks feed into a shared national working group model.

- Define status, organisational form, and representativeness criteria.
- Set shared strategy, goals, and actions for dissemination and findability of Swiss research outputs.
- Sustain interoperability progress beyond the project period.
