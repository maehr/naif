## Project context

National Approach for Interoperable repositories and Findable research results (NAIF) is a project initiated and funded by eight Swiss Higher Education Institutions and co-funded by swissuniversities.
It aims to enable more interoperability and standardization across Swiss institutional repositories.
The project started in July 2025 and will end in December 2026.

The project partners are:

- [ETH Library (ETH Zurich)](https://library.ethz.ch/en/)
- [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html)
- [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)
- [ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/)
- [PHSG St.Gallen University of Teacher Education](https://www.phsg.ch/en/)

## Background and objectives

Swiss Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) operate institutional repositories, but practices and metadata quality vary widely.
This makes it hard to get a reliable, system-wide view of Swiss research outputs and limits meaningful, standardized analysis.

NAIF addresses this by combining conceptual work (what a national approach should look like) with technical work (what interoperability requires in practice).

**Objectives**

- Make research outputs by researchers at Swiss HEIs more visible.
- Improve the data basis for monitoring and steering Swiss research, with a focus on Open Access.
- Promote the responsible use of indicators in research assessment (aligned with DORA and CoARA).

**Approach**

- Work towards shared standards and interoperability across repositories.
- Develop scenarios for a national approach to disseminate and reuse Swiss research results.
- Identify the factors that ensure dissemination (integration into global ecosystems) and findability (high-quality metadata).

## Timeline (high level)

- **Jul 2025:** Project start
- **2025-2026:** Track activities (workshops, inventories, consultations, recommendations)
- **Dec 2026:** Project end

## Tracks

### Track 1: Responsible use of quantitative indicators
*Responsible partners: ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, ETH Zurich, University of Zurich (CHESS)*

This track promotes the responsible use of indicators for research assessment, building on the national approach (track 2) and standardized repositories (tracks 3-4).

- Align guidance with DORA and CoARA.
- Connect indicator use to metadata standardization priorities.
- Engage the Swiss Year of Scientometrics (SYoS) community and CHESS.


### Track 2: Review of national approaches and development of scenarios for Switzerland
*Responsible partners: University of Zurich, ETH Zurich*

This track reviews international national approaches and develops scenarios for Switzerland.

- Run structured workshops with international experts.
- Compare stakeholder models, funding, sustainability, and technical solutions (federated vs. centralized).
- Gather Swiss stakeholder requirements via consultations (e.g., roundtables, white papers).
- Consider secondary publication rights.

### Track 3: Survey and analysis of Swiss institutional repositories
*Responsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL*

This track focuses on the existing institutional repositories.
The starting point will be a list of institutional repositories from [institutions that are accredited by swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/studying/accredited-swiss-higher-education-institutions-1).
Such an inventory aims to provide an in-depth analysis of repositories, and can be seen as a systematic extension of the broad overview given through the
list of participating institutions in the [Swiss Open Access Monitor](https://oamonitor.ch/wiki/participating-institutions-repo-monitor/).
Part of these repositories will be investigated in terms of
(a) already implemented standards and certifications (e.g., OpenAIRE guidelines, CoreTrustSeal) as well as repository software currently in use,
(b) metadata availability, quality, and completeness, evaluating their alignment with international best practices
(e.g., OpenAIRE, Dublin Core, DataCite), 
(c) technical requirements identifying existing barriers to seamless data exchange and integration.
Because of the heterogeneity of the current landscape and the number of institutions (50+), some parts of the inventory may focus on a subset of institutions whose selection will partly depend on institutions' willingness to participate.
Once the inventory has been completed, a report featuring the results of the gap analysis will be prepared.
The report will help to determine common denominators among institutional repositories to assess the feasibility of metadata harmonization.
It may also provide feasible recommendations to enhance alignment with national and international frameworks (e.g., OpenAIRE guidelines), help building a shared and standardized metadata framework that takes the characteristics of Switzerland into account.


### Track 4: Enhancement of national and global academic data
*Responsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL*

This track focuses on data that have already been, or that will be, integrated into institutional repositories, but that are sourced elsewhere, such as identifiers for Swiss organizations (e.g., ROR), researchers active in Switzerland (e.g., ORCID), funding information for Swiss or international projects and OA information (OA type, document version, embargo, APCs). A workshop and a virtual session will gather stakeholders to determine which academic data are relevant, and which measures or actions could be taken to improve their findability or their quality.
The workshop and the virtual session will also determine the selection of measures or actions that will be implemented. These translate into deliverables that could consist in guidelines or in concrete actions such as the establishment of a mapping of Swiss organizations or an authoritative list of researchers active in the country.


### Unified outcome: Creation of a working group
*Responsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL, ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, University of Zurich*

This unified outcome aims to establish a working group that will make advancements towards more interoperability and standardization across institutional repositories in Switzerland.
Using the preliminary findings of the conceptual requirements identified by the tracks *responsible use of quantitative indicators* and *review of national approaches and development of scenarios for Switzerland* as well as the technical recommendations of the tracks *survey and analysis of Swiss institutional repositories* and *enhancement of national and global academic data*, project participants will define the status of the working group, its organizational form, criteria of representativity, as well as goals, strategy, and actions to enhance the visibility of Swiss research results and to ensure smooth data dissemination.
