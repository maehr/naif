This public guide explains how to publish NAIF news posts and event entries. It is intended for project partners and anyone contributing content.

## Target audiences and message priorities

### Primary audiences

- NAIF project partners: shared alignment, progress transparency, coordination signals (public-facing).
- Swissuniversities: accountable reporting, sector relevance, evidence of delivery against objectives.
- ETH Board and governance stakeholders: strategic value, interoperability outcomes, sustainability pathway.

### Secondary audiences

- Research staff, libraries, repository owners, open science infrastructure community, interested public.

### Message architecture (use consistently)

- **Why it matters**: interoperability, metadata quality, responsible indicators, findability of Swiss research.
- **What we did**: activities, methods, consultations, analyses.
- **What we found**: interim insights, constraints, recommendations.
- **What's next**: planned actions, opportunities to engage, upcoming events.
- **What to reuse**: outputs with persistent identifiers (DOIs, ROR, ORCID references as relevant).

## Folder structure and filenames

- News posts: `posts/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<slug>/index.qmd`
- Events: `events/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<slug>/index.qmd`
- Post assets: `posts/<entry>/images/*`
- Event assets: `events/<entry>/images/*`
- Rendered output lives in `_site/` (do not edit `_site/` manually).

## Language and spelling

- Use British English for news posts and non-repost event pages.
- Reposts may retain original wording and spelling when needed for faithful attribution.

## News post guidance

Use a news post for updates, progress reporting, findings, or opinion pieces.

**Required front matter**

- `title` (<= 70 chars)
- `subtitle` (optional; concise one-line context)
- `date` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `author`
- `description` (<= 280 chars)
- `other-links` (when there is a related event page)
- `categories`: exactly one of `Track 1`, `Track 2`, `Track 3`, `Track 4`, `General` (use `General` only for track-independent posts)
- `tags`: exactly 3 tags
- `proofread`: `true` or `false`
- `image`: local image path (used for listing cards)

**Content structure**

- Put the lead text in the `description` front matter field.
- Do not add an explicit `## Lead` heading or a lead paragraph block in the body.
- Follow the message architecture above.
- Keep the post concise (500-3000 chars as a guideline).
- Use `## References` only with Pandoc citeproc (`bibliography` + citation keys like `[@key]`).
  Otherwise, add links inline or use `## Sources` / `## Further reading`.
- Use academic titles (`Dr`, `Prof`, etc.) consistently where known, and do not mix titled and
  untitled variants of the same person.

## Event guidance

Use an event entry for announcements and event documentation.

**Required front matter**

- `title` (<= 70 chars)
- `date` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `author` (organizer name)
- `author-title`: `Organizer`
- `description` (<= 280 chars)
- `other-links` (when there is a related post page)
- `categories`: exactly one: `Organised by NAIF`, `Participation by NAIF`, or `Related Topic`
- `tags`: exactly 3 tags
- `proofread`: `true` or `false`
- `image`: local image path (used for listing cards)

**Event details**

- Include Date and as many of the following as are available: Time, Location, Registration, Event page.
- Future events: keep Registration and Event page as clickable links when available.
- Past events: if a registration link existed, render it as plain text and strikethrough, and add a short note that the event already took place.
- If a detail is not available (for example no registration was offered), state this explicitly in plain text.

## Images and rights

- Use 1-3 high-resolution images where possible.
- Every image must have descriptive alt text, a caption, and rights attribution.

## Reposts of external content

- Republishing articles that have already been published requires explicit permission by the original publisher.
- Add a visible note near the top linking back to the original URL.

## Drafts

- Use `draft: true` in the front matter for work-in-progress content.
- Drafts are visible in `quarto preview` only and excluded from `quarto render` outputs.

## Reuse and identifiers

- Link outputs with persistent identifiers (DOIs, ROR, ORCID references) whenever relevant.
- NAIF deliverables are archived on Zenodo: [Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/naif)
