## Content contributions

- Blog entries must follow the folder-per-entry structure described in `AGENTS.md`.
- British English is preferred for posts and event pages, except reposts where source wording may be
  preserved.
- Keep images local to the entry folder and include alt text, caption, and rights attribution.
- Posts and events inherit a fallback card image via `posts/_metadata.yml` and
  `events/_metadata.yml`; set a page-level `image:` in each entry to override this default.
- Post and event pages show the front-matter `image:` near the page title via a Quarto template
  partial.
- Use `image-alt:` for accessibility; if omitted, the page title is used as fallback alt text.
- Use `image-caption:` for the on-page image caption, including source and rights attribution;
  directory metadata provides a generic fallback caption.
- To avoid duplicate page images, set `show-page-image: false` in front matter when you add your own
  manual image(s) in the body content.
